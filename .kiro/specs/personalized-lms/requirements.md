# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Open Source Learning Management System (LMS) that generates personalized content and learning roadmaps based on individual students' prior knowledge and learning progress. The system supports a variety of media types, including images, videos, files, and rich text content, organized into lessons and courses to provide a structured learning experience. The system will be built using Svelte 5 and SvelteKit 2 with Supabase as the backend database, supporting both media uploads and YouTube video integration for cost-effective content hosting.
