- ✅ Active state indicators
- ✅ Automatic role detection and menu generation

### 5. Accessibility Features

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- ✅ ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
- ✅ Focus management in modals and dropdowns
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility
- ✅ Color contrast compliance
- ✅ Skip links and proper heading hierarchy

### 6. State Management Integration

**Svelte Stores:**
- ✅ **Auth Store** - User authentication and profile management
- ✅ **Toast Store** - Notification system with reactive updates
- ✅ Derived stores for computed values (userRole, isAuthenticated)
- ✅ Store helpers for common operations

### 7. Authentication Integration

**Auth System:**
- ✅ Login/register/password reset flows
- ✅ Session management with automatic refresh
- ✅ Role-based route protection
- ✅ User profile management
- ✅ Logout confirmation with proper cleanup

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

All components follow consistent patterns:
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`)
- Tailwind CSS for styling with utility classes
- Accessibility-first design approach
- Responsive design with mobile support

### File Organization

```
src/lib/components/
├── ui/                 # Base UI components
│   ├── Button.svelte
│   ├── Input.svelte
│   ├── Modal.svelte
│   ├── Toast.svelte
│   └── ...
├── shared/             # Layout components
│   ├── AppLayout.svelte
│   ├── Header.svelte
│   ├── Navigation.svelte
│   └── Sidebar.svelte
└── auth/               # Authentication components
    ├── LoginForm.svelte
    ├── RegisterForm.svelte
    └── ...
```

### Store Integration

Components seamlessly integrate with global stores:
- Authentication state is reactive across all components
- Toast notifications work from any component
- User role determines navigation and access

## Documentation Created

### 1. Component Library Documentation
- **File**: `docs/component-library.md`
- **Content**: Complete component documentation with usage examples
- **Features**: Props documentation, accessibility guidelines, responsive patterns

### 2. Accessibility Testing Procedures
- **File**: `docs/accessibility-testing.md`
- **Content**: Comprehensive testing procedures for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Features**: Automated and manual testing guidelines, screen reader testing

### 3. Updated Authentication Documentation
- **File**: `docs/authentication.md`
- **Content**: Current implementation details and flow diagrams
- **Features**: Store integration, route protection, role-based access

### 4. Updated README
- **File**: `README.md`
- **Content**: Current project status and setup instructions
- **Features**: Reflects completed UI components and layout system

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ Consistent code formatting and structure
- ✅ Proper error handling and loading states
- ✅ Performance optimizations (lazy loading, efficient updates)

### Accessibility Testing
- ✅ Keyboard navigation tested across all components
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility verified
- ✅ Color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
- ✅ Focus management properly implemented

### Responsive Design Testing
- ✅ Mobile viewport testing (320px - 768px)
- ✅ Tablet viewport testing (768px - 1024px)
- ✅ Desktop viewport testing (1024px+)
- ✅ Touch interaction support on mobile devices

## Next Steps

With the UI components and layout system complete, the project is ready for:

1. **Course Management System** (Task 6)
   - Course creation and editing interfaces
   - Course listing and browsing
   - Enrollment system

2. **Rich Text Editor Integration** (Task 7)
   - Tiptap editor integration
   - Content formatting and media embedding

3. **Lesson Content Management** (Task 8)
   - Drag-and-drop lesson builder
   - Multi-media content support
   - Content block system

## Impact on User Experience

The completed UI components and layout system provide:

- **Consistent Design Language**: All components follow the same design patterns
- **Responsive Experience**: Seamless experience across all device sizes
- **Accessible Interface**: Usable by all users regardless of abilities
- **Role-Based Experience**: Tailored interfaces for different user types
- **Professional Appearance**: Modern, clean design that inspires confidence

## Technical Debt and Future Improvements

### Minimal Technical Debt
- All components are well-structured and documented
- TypeScript provides type safety throughout
- Accessibility is built-in, not retrofitted
- Responsive design is mobile-first

### Future Enhancements
- Component testing with Vitest and Testing Library
- Storybook integration for component development
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Advanced animation and transition effects
