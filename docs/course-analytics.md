## Optimization Strategies

### Content Optimization

**Based on Engagement Data:**

1. **Low Engagement Content:**
   - Identify content with high dropout rates
   - Analyze session duration for specific lessons
   - Review content complexity and length
   - Consider multimedia alternatives

2. **High Engagement Content:**
   - Analyze successful content characteristics
   - Replicate effective formats
