# Project Status Update

## Date: Current

## Changes Made

### Task Status Update
- **Task 7: Rich Text Editor Integration** has been changed from completed back to **IN PROGRESS**
- This reflects that while the content sanitization framework is in place, the full Tiptap integration needs completion

### Documentation Updates

#### 1. Implementation Progress (`docs/implementation-progress.md`)
- Updated status from "COMPLETED" to "IN PROGRESS" for Task 7
- Revised the feature completion list to reflect current state
- Added clear breakdown of completed vs. remaining work for rich text editor

#### 2. README.md
- Updated project roadmap to show Rich Text Editor Integration as current task (ðŸ”„)
- Added content sanitization framework as completed item
- Adjusted next steps to reflect current priorities

#### 3. Rich Text Editor Documentation (`docs/rich-text-editor.md`)
- Added implementation status indicator showing "IN PROGRESS"
- Updated overview to reflect future implementation rather than completed work

## Current Project State

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. Complete Tiptap rich text editor integration
2. Implement lesson content management
3. Build assessment system with AI generation
4. Add student progress tracking
5. Develop AI-powered personalized roadmaps

## Technical Debt and Considerations

### Minimal Technical Debt
- All completed features are well-documented and tested
- TypeScript provides comprehensive type safety
- Accessibility is built-in from the start
- Database schema is properly normalized and secured

### Areas for Improvement
- Rich text editor needs completion for content creation workflows
- File upload system needs implementation for media content
- Assessment system requires development for learning validation
- AI integration pending for personalization features

## Development Guidelines Maintained

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled throughout
- Consistent component architecture with Svelte 5 runes
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Accessibility-first design approach

### Documentation Standards
- All major features documented with examples
- API documentation includes request/response formats
- Database schema fully documented with relationships
- Setup instructions are comprehensive and tested

### Security Practices
- Row Level Security (RLS) implemented for all tables
- Content sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- Role-based access control throughout application
- Input validation on both client and server sides

## Deployment Readiness

### Current State
- Application is deployable with current feature set
- Database migrations are production-ready
- Environment configuration is properly documented
- Build process is optimized for production

### Missing for Full Feature Set
- Rich text editor completion for content creation
- File upload system for media management
- Assessment system for learning validation
- AI integration for personalization

## Community and Contribution
